        <h2>FIRST PART</h2>
        <h3>I. First Encounter</h3>
        <p>1. The first time I crossed paths with Dong Mengting was during the summer of 2017, on the final day of
            pre-freshman military training. We were in formation, getting ready to depart from the training base. She
            was up at the front of the line, grinning and asking our classmates, "Are there any other Dongs in our
            class?" In that split second, our eyes met, and I felt a kind of emotion I'd never felt before. That's when
            I started keeping an eye on her.</p>
        <p>2. On the first day of school, when we all showed up for roll call in our regular clothes, Du Xinyu ended up
            sitting next to me. Nobody was in uniform yet. She was wearing these thin, kinda see-through long pants that
            showed off her white triangle panties underneath. Those panties were snug against her slightly chubby butt,
            making her look extra sexy.</p>
        <p>3. On the first day of sophomore year, as I was headin' downstairs to head home, I ran into this girl. Since
            I didn't know her name, let's just call her High School Girl A for now. She was walkin' behind me, wearin' a
            light pink blouse and a super short skirt, with bare legs and women's sneakers. Her chest was small, but
            just right, matchin' her slender legs and slim figure. In my mind, she should be wearin' a black bra and
            sexy thong. I was thinkin' of usin' the stairs' height difference to sneak a peek at her undies, but by then
            I was real close to the stairs, so to avoid bein' caught, I had to give up.</p>
