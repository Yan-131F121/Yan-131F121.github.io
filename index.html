        <h3>A Folk Song</h3>
        <div class="poetry-paragraph">
            <p>In the stillness of the night's first watch, by the mirror, candles burn bright, unveiling a decree of
                jade.</p>
            <p>On the platform, the passage of time proves elusive, with brushes easily broken, ink losing its purity,
                as the world awaits the coming dawn.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="poetry-paragraph">
            <p>As the night's second watch arrives, seeking to capture thoughts yet finding none.</p>
            <p>Gazing at the bright moon, exploring mystical mountains, where nature's beauty fades, waterfalls run
                crimson, and white bones vanish into emerald mists.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="poetry-paragraph">
            <p>In the third watch of the night, the colorful scroll torn and hard to mend.</p>
            <p>The frosty winds hasten the year's end, crossing mountains proves arduous, with expedition's grass
                withered, ten departures but none return.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="poetry-paragraph">
            <p>At the fourth watch of the night, crickets chirp, clocks stop, the painting remains unfinished.</p>
            <p>Misinterpreting the remnants of a bygone era, ancient temples shrouded in deep cold, branches of
                crabapple trees broken, blank stone tablets hanging.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="poetry-paragraph">
            <p>By the fifth watch of the night, the solitary lamp flickers out, the window yearns for the breaking dawn.
            </p>
            <p>Dreams within the painting are not folly, as harvests ripen, and in a single night, the ashes extinguish,
                the dawn's light turning paper to ash.</p>
        </div>
    </main>
