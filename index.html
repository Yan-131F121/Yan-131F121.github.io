        <h3>I.</h3>
        <p>The first time I crossed paths with Dong Mengting was during the summer of 2017, on the final day of
            pre-freshman military training. We were in formation, getting ready to depart from the training base. She
            was up at the front of the line, grinning and asking our classmates, "Are there any other Dongs in our
            class?" In that split second, our eyes met, and I felt a kind of emotion I'd never felt before. That's when
            I started keeping an eye on her.</p>
